Napoleon Hill as a youth was no different from most young people today. He associated success with money in his early career. He wanted to be important, with a display of opulence. People today tend to associate the popular book Think and Grow Rich in terms of money-but Hill's perspective was to change as he matured. Hill remarked in one of his papers that during his early career when he was receiving large sums of money, he believed it essential that he drive nothing less than a RollsRoyce. He purchased a large estate in New York; he had servants and a variety of other employees to tend to his wants. This extravagant spending prior to the Great Depression of 1929 led to Hill losing his possessions and, later on, his estate. When Grow Rich! with Peace ofMind was published in 1967, Hill was eighty-four years old. His message had changed. He was older, much wiser, and he wanted to portray the importance of peace of mind. Hill in Grow Rich! with Peace ofMind states he is trying to help the reader avoid the mistakes he made. As you read the book, perhaps you can learn from Hill's life that many other things besides money and material items are needed in order to truly have peace of mind. You will read of learning from your past, developing a positive mental attitude, living life free of fear, and the importance of sharing your wealth with others. Napoleon Hill had a very interesting life of research, interviews, and writings as to what constitute success. This final book combines all of his knowledge on living a life with peace of mind.
